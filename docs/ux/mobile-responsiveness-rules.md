# Mobile Responsiveness Rules

## Breakpoints
1. Mobile: up to 767 px.
2. Tablet: 768 px to 1023 px.
3. Desktop: 1024 px and above.

## Navigation Behavior
1. Desktop/tablet use top or side global navigation.
2. Mobile uses bottom global navigation.
3. Trip sub-navigation uses segmented tabs on mobile.

## Layout Rules
1. Single-column default on mobile for readability.
2. Critical controls stay within thumb-reach zones on mobile.
3. Desktop itinerary supports list/map split-view.
4. Mobile itinerary defaults to list with map fallback entry point.

## Interaction Rules
1. Mobile itinerary supports hybrid move interaction:
- drag via handle.
- fallback move action menu.
2. Long forms use step sections and sticky action bars where useful.
3. Bottom sheets are preferred for auth gates and quick actions.

## Performance Rules
1. Keep above-the-fold payload minimal.
2. Delay non-critical media and heavy map resources.
3. Keep animation subtle and inexpensive.
