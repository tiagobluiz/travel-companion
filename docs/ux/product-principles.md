# Product UX Principles

## North Star
Travel Companion is a planning-first social travel product. The experience should help a user move from idea to structured trip quickly, then collaborate and share without friction.

## Experience Pillars
1. Utility before novelty: Every screen should make planning actions obvious and fast.
2. Premium restraint: Visual quality should feel polished, calm, and intentional without being flashy.
3. Mobile-flawless web: All critical actions must be easy on mobile web first, not desktop-only.
4. Role clarity: A user should always understand what they can view or edit.
5. Recoverable interactions: Drag, move, edit, and delete actions must be clear and reversible by user action.

## Non-Negotiable Rule
Product UX consistency is mandatory at every level. This is the governing rule for all design and FE work.
1. Visual consistency: typography, spacing, radius, elevation, icon style, color semantics.
2. Interaction consistency: control behavior, feedback patterns, loading/empty/error states, navigation behavior.
3. Content consistency: naming, tone, labels, microcopy, and status language.
4. Accessibility consistency: focus, keyboard behavior, contrast, and touch target expectations.
5. Cross-platform consistency: desktop/tablet/mobile behaviors must feel like one coherent product.

## Product Tone
Use practical and aspirational tone together:
- Practical: clear action labels, straightforward errors.
- Aspirational: inspiring but concise travel language in empty states and headers.

## Design Decisions Locked
1. WCAG AA accessibility target.
2. English first, i18n-ready layout and content structure.
3. Motion style is subtle and purposeful (Linear-like).
4. Responsive navigation model:
- Desktop/tablet: top or side nav.
- Mobile: bottom nav.

## Quality Gate Rules
No FE issue is implementation-ready unless:
1. Flow map is approved.
2. Loading/empty/error/permission states are specified.
3. Accessibility checklist is complete.
4. Responsive behavior is defined.
5. Render references are attached.
6. Acceptance criteria are measurable.
