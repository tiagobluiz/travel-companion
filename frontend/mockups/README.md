# Mockup Pages

These mock pages are coded references for FE implementation and visual QA.

## Files
1. `discovery-auth-shell.html`
2. `dashboard-tabs.html`
3. `trip-planning-board.html`
4. `styles.css`

## Usage
Open HTML files directly in browser, or serve from local static host.

## Intent
1. Complex flows should match these mocks closely.
2. Simpler flows can follow docs/guidelines with controlled variance.
